Basic Plus Syntax Formatting
Basic Plus Syntax Formatting is a Visual Studio Code extension that provides syntax highlighting and formatting for the Basic Plus language (.bp,.bpi,.bpm files). This extension enhances the readability of your Basic Plus code by applying colors and formats to keywords, strings, and other language constructs.

Features
Syntax Highlighting: Supports custom coloring for keywords, strings, and control structures in Basic Plus code files.
Customizable Color Scheme: The extension provides a default color scheme, where keywords like If, While, For, and Function are highlighted in a light blue for better visibility.
String Formatting: Double-quoted strings are highlighted, along with escape sequences.
Example of keyword highlighting:


𝐾𝑒𝑦𝑤𝑜𝑟𝑑𝐻𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑙𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑔


Requirements
This extension does not require any external dependencies. It works out-of-the-box for Basic Plus (.bp,.bpi,.bpm) files.

Extension Settings
This extension does not add any custom settings to the VS Code configuration at the moment. Future releases may include options for customizing the color scheme or adding more language-specific features.

Known Issues
Some complex Basic Plus constructs may not be highlighted properly. We are actively working on improving the grammar file to support more language features.
If you encounter any issues with the extension, please report them on the GitHub issue tracker.
